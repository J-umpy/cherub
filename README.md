# Cherub

Cherub is an open-source Discord bot that pulls data from Discord servers and writes to an SQLite Database
In other words, Cherub is a Discord bot that logs all messages from your server.

# Features
- Collects Discord messages with metadata
- Data is easily intepretable by machines, and steps were taken to ensure compatibility with more limited languages
- Can be used for analytics or machine learning
- The ability to delete all collected data from a specific user at will, meaning Cherub is entirely compliant with Discord's ToS
