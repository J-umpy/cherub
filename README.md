Cherub is an open-source Discord bot that pulls data from Discord servers and writes to Google Sheets.
Please note that this is not currently ready to be downloaded and used. It functions, but you'll need to create a credentials.json and setup.json file, and configure it correctly in order to make it work. A full usable release will be available soon
In other words, Cherub is a Discord bot that logs all messages from your server.
