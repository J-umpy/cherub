# Cherub
Cherub is an open-source Discord bot that pulls data from Discord servers and writes to Google Sheets.
Please note that this is not currently ready to be downloaded and used. It functions, but you'll need to create a credentials.json and setup.json file, and configure it correctly in order to make it work. A full usable release will be available soon

# Features
- Collects of Discord messages with metadata
- Collects message counts and determines usage data

# Feature Plans
- Have the graphs actually embed within Discord (Google Sheets is a pain to work with)
- Improve data sorting to allow for more efficient data interpretation for other projects. 
      EX) If you were to use this data for a machine learning chatbot, filtering messages from #general and #bot-commands would consume a             considerable amount of time
- Setup wizard and documentation for installation and setup
- Error code compilation, solution, and other documentation
