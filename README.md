# Cherub
Cherub is an open-source Discord bot that pulls data from Discord servers and writes to Google Sheets.

# Features
- Collects of Discord messages with metadata
- Collects message counts and determines usage data

# Feature Plans
- Have the graphs actually embed within Discord (Google Sheets is a pain to work with)
- Improve data sorting to allow for more efficient data interpretation for other projects. 
      EX) If you were to use this data for a machine learning chatbot, filtering messages from #general and #bot-commands would consume a             considerable amount of time
- Setup wizard and documentation for installation and setup
- Error code compilation, solution, and other documentation
